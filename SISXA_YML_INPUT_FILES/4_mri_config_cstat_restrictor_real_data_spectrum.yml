# Multiple round inference YAML configuration file - Based on Table 1 of Barret & Dupourqu√© (2024, A&A)
# This one highlights the use of the restrictor based on the cstat. This is not the most efficient way
# to restrict the priors, but shows how to implement an arbitrary function to do so. For real data, the restrictor
# obtained from a quick and coarse inference is working very well.
# The spectrum is modeled by the sum of an absorbed power law and blackbody. Alternative models may fit the data better
# but at the time of the writing of the paper, those models were not available in jaxspec.
